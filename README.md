# Unit-test
### Unit Testing Using Jest with the AAA Pattern 
- Jest is a Javascript Testing framework built by Facebook.
- In this exercise, I wrote a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the Jest library. 
- I followed the AAA pattern to make the tests easier for other developers to read and understand. And  also I used TDD approach in practice.
#Getting Started
- To install Jest run ```
                        npm install --save-dev jest
                       ```
- To run the test ```
                        npm test
                       ```
